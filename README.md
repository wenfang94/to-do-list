# to-do-list
Used Vue and Local Storage to create a persistent to-do list application.

When the page loads, the app loads for items stored in Local Storage and update the app data.
Existing items are displayed in a list.
Items are displayed as complete or incomplete.
A form is there to allow new items to be added to the list.
Clicking on an item should toggle the item's complete state.
A delete button is next to each item. When clicked, the item will be deleted from the list
Any changes to the list will be propagated to the Local Storage
